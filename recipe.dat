NULL<>The Best Parmesan Chicken Bake<>This chicken Parmesan is done casserole style (so, no breading or frying!), but still offers up that irresistible combination of tender chicken, crunchy/cheesy coating, and flavorful sauce.<>NULL<>1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 2.Coat the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole dish with olive oil, and sprinkle with garlic and hot red pepper flakes. 3.Arrange the chicken breasts in bottom of the dish, and pour marinara sauce over chicken. Sprinkle basil over marinara sauce, and top with half the mozzarella cheese, followed by half the Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle on the croutons, then top with the remaining mozzarella cheese and remaining Parmesan cheese. 4.Bake in preheated oven until cheese and croutons are golden brown and the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 35 minutes to an hour, depending on the shape and thickness of your chicken breasts. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).<>6<>00:50:00<>Dinner
NULL<>Sausage Hash Brown Breakfast Casserole<>This super-easy breakfast casserole is actually good. You can make it the night before and keep the sausage/hash brown mixture separate from the egg mixture, then pour it over top right before it goes into the oven. You might need to cook it a little longer if its cold from the fridge. This is also great if you add a little onion.<>NULL<>1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a half-casserole baking dish or deep-dish pie plate. 2.Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. 3.Stir hash browns, cooked sausage, Cheddar cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, and remaining salt together in another bowl. Pour hash brown mixture into prepared baking dish; pour egg mixture evenly over hash brown mixture. 4.Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden, about 45 minutes.<>4<>01:00:00<>Breakfast
NULL<>Refreshing Limoncello Cake<>This is a perfect ending to an Italian dinner! A favorite of my family's, this recipe was born as we were trying to figure out how to incorporate our bottles of imported limoncello into a yummy dessert. It's our adult twist on the always refreshing lemonade cake (and surprisingly guilt-free!).<>NULL<>1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare an 8-inch cake pan with cooking spray. 2.Whisk together the yogurt, eggs, canola oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, and 4 tablespoons limoncello in a large bowl. In a separate large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Gently stir the dry ingredients into the wet. Do not over mix or the cake will be tough. Pour batter into prepared pan. 3.Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. 4.Stir the powdered sugar and 3 tablespoons of limoncello together in a small bowl until smooth. Poke small holes all over the top of the still-warm cake with a fork or toothpick. Spoon the glaze over the cake and spread with the back of a spoon. The glaze will seep into the cake and add moisture.<>8<>00:50:00<>Dessert
